# Paint Jam - May 2021

## Theme: Campbell's Soup!

Paint Jam is a game jam based off the high tech, revolutionary, graphics editor that comes
pre-installed on Windows whatever. This jam is for people who want an excuse to make a little game
using only MS Paint as a graphics editing tool.

Brought to you by the folks over at Snoozy Kazoo!

## Team:

- Game Programmer: Querijn! That's me! I will work on the main core loop.
- System Programmer: Ray! Ray will mostly work on technical behind the scene stuff.
- Cristian: Our artist; absolute genius at a lot of art styles.
- Ryan: Our musician! He'll create the music/sound effects for the game :slight_smile:

## Rules

- Don't be a jerk.
- Use MS Paint, or any MS Paint alternatives!
- All code, gameplay, writing, art, and everything else MUST be made DURING the jam!
- You can use other art tools to create transparency.
- You can use system code (saving, loading, or other common game systems) you wrote before the jam,
  but don't use anything that defeats the purpose of doing the jam at all (for example, an entire
  game, or a template gotten off an asset store), or anything that would get you in legal trouble.
- Do not infringe copyright laws.
- Don't do something that will make me edit this rules section.
- Have fun!

## Challenges

These are little optional things you can do to make your life a living hell. Mix and match, but
please don't do them all.

- Make all your own sound effects using only sounds you can make with your mouth. Onomatopoeia
  recommended.
- Only use the default MS Paint color palette.
- Make a 3D game only using flat images. No meshes except for like the world/levels.
- Use only comic sans for any in-game font.
- Draw your assets without a drawing tablet.
- Try to make the title/logo without any real type/font.
- Draw all of your art with your eyes closed.
- Only use the pencil tool.
- No transparencies.
